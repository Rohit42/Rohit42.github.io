I'm a student, software developer, and hackathon attendee from Georgia Tech. Here at Tech, I'm pursuing the Intelligence and Theory concentrations. In the future, I look to leverage the skills I gain in Quantitative Finance or Computational Biology. Till then, I look to gain industry and research experience in tech, finance, and bioinformatics.

              <h2>Citadel DataOpens</h2>
              <p>I participated in 2 DataOpens hosted by Citadel and Correlation One. Each time, I was joined with 3 other members to clean, parse, analyze 3 GBs of data. The first competition took place in February 2018. We were given data on 6 cities across the United States with data ranging from accidents to funding for buildings. My team worked to use this dataset in conjunction with data pulled from the US Census to create heatmaps of accidents and traffic patterns. With these we analyzed the city of Atlanta and determined an optimal spot to place a new hospital and predicted the effect it might have on traffic. This report won first prize of $20,000 and secured us a spot in the final round in the coming November. The second competition took place July 2018. We were given 2 GBs of airline data. We decided to examine the effect of the interconnectedness of airline on its stability to external factors (e.g weather, fuel prices). To do so, we to the minimum spanning tree of a distance weighted graph for each airline to see coverage. We concluded there was no significant correlation between interconnectedness and stability.<p>

              <p>WeLocate was the product of myself and 3 friend's 36 hour caffeine chocolate coding session. WeLocate at its core is meant to help small and medium businesses looking to expand their single shops. In expansion, one of the most important factors and struggles is finding a location. WeLocate is a webapp that attempts to find a data-driven solution to that problem. It prompts the user to choose a starting location on a map, specify a radius to search, and describe their type of store. Using data collected from the Yelp API and the AWS machine learning studio, WeLocate provides a map of optimal places to start a new business. With WeLocate, the challenge facing local businesses to fend off large chain competition becomes a little less daunting.</p>

              <h2>Pokemon Go - Swarm Solution</h2>
              <p>Every morning of the summer after my junior year, my friend would pick me up from my local park for our joint research. At times, he would be running late and <i>(as any avid Pokemon fan would do)</i> I took that time to play Pokemon Go. The park boasted a whopping <b>18</b> pokemon stops. After a few weeks of collecting my morning Pokemon loot, I wondered the optimal circuit. Conveniently that summer, I was researching robotics swarm solutions and I read a paper discussing the use of swarms for a heuristic solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. I realized that with some alterations, it could give me an optimal circuit too. So I created a distance weighted graph using Google Maps and a timed walking speed. After accounting for Pokemon Stops resetting every 5 minutes, I unleashed my swarm solution and found reasonable success. :) </p>

At BazaarVoice I worked to create image detection models to detect copyright infringement. I used python, Keras, and tensorflow to create two models to detect elements of copyright detection. The first filtered out photos with text overlaid on top with 92% accuracy and the second detected stock photos with 88% accuracy. Together these models automate up 17% of moderation saving the company roughly $50,000 worth of moderation every year. In the latter half of the summer, I worked to create models to rate the quality of photos, to help choose "featured" photos.    </p>

One such feature was the diversity of suggestions. To do so, I used Word2Vec and to create an entropy model to quantify the diversity. Other features included characters saved, distance of the most relevant suggestion to actual search, average distance of the suggestions to the actual search. In the future, these analyses will guide the development of a metric to improve current suggestion models and compare to competitors suggestion models.  </p>
